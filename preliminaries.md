# Preliminaries

* You will need to have a 'Terminal' set up on your computer.  If you're running a Mac, it _is_ installed.  Just search for 'Terminal.'  If you have a Windows machine, you'll need to install [cygwin](https://cywgin.com/install.html).  Since the Windows install is a bit more finnicky, you can find additional instructions [here](windows_install_instructions.md). 
* Download the Python 3.5, 64-bit [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (Graphical Installer is easier), and install it on your computer.  (It may ask for your business email -- ignore it.)  When the install is complete, if you now run your Terminal and type `python`, then hit `<Enter>`, you should get a new command prompt.  It should say `Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda...`  You can test it out (`1 + 1`, then `<Enter>`) and quit (`quit()` or `ctrl+D` on a Mac).  As above -- Windows users please see the [additional instructions](windows_install_instructions.md).
* I encourage you to use [Atom](atom.io) as a text editor for your first assignment; it provides syntax highlighting that you will find useful.  The [Download](atom.io) and installation should be trivial.  If you want, you can delete it when you're done.
  * Atom requires OS X 10.8 or later.  For 10.6 or 10.7, try Sublime or TextWrangler ([4.5.12](http://www.barebones.com/support/textwrangler/updates.html)).
