# Assignment 1: Welcome to Python 

### Preliminaries/Setup
* You will need to have a 'Terminal' set up on your computer.  If you're running a Mac, it _is_ installed.  Just search for 'Terminal.'  If you have a Windows machine, you'll need to install cygwin.  Since the Windows install is a bit more finnicky, you can find additional instructions [here](windows_install_instructions.md). 
* Get [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) fully set up on your computer.  If you now run your Terminal and type `python`, you should get a new command prompt, where you can test it out (`1 + 1`, `<Enter>`) and quit (`quit()` or `ctrl+D`).
* Create a [student GitHub account](https://education.github.com/pack).  You will use this account to push (submit) all of your work.  You can then join this assignment, [here](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/20690068-introduction-to-public-policy-30550-uc-harris).  (**Complete this: download the directory, etc.**)  Next Monday, we'll discuss `git`, why we're using it (spoiler: everyone does), and how to do all of this from the command line.
* I encourage you to use [Atom](atom.io) as a text editor for your first assignment; it provides syntax highlighting that you will find useful.  If you want, you can delete it when you're done.

### Excitement and Exercises!
1. Find the 9th number that is a multiple of 4, 13, 14, 26, and 50.
2. Fibonacci numbers are defined by adding the previous two terms.  Starting with 0 and 1, that gives 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.  Find the sum of all Fibonnacci numbers divisible by 17 and below 1 billion.  (`while` and `if`, and `%`)
3. Find the prime factors of.  (Hint: first make a list of all the primes you'll need.)
4.
